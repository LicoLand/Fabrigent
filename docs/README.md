# Fabrigent Documentation

This directory is the canonical index of Fabrigent's formal documentation.
It records implemented and verified facts about the federation contract, the
governance policy, the artifact pipeline, and repository operation.
Proposals, plans, and unverified conclusions stay in ignored local material
under `docs/plans/`, never in tracked documents.

## Documentation Rules

- Document only implemented, verified facts. Every technical fact has one
  canonical authority in `contracts/`, `policies/`, `conformance/`,
  `artifacts/`, or a formal document; other documents reference it.
- Update formal documentation in the same change that alters the capability
  or boundary it describes.
- Examples must be synthetic and privacy-safe.
- Local plans (`docs/plans/`), reports (`docs/reports/`), caches (`cache/`),
  and build outputs (`build/`) are ignored and must never be tracked.
